Representative Task 1 (vertically implemented):
	In this task, the user is looking for a pro-gun protest in their area so they can find out when it's happening. This is done by looking through the categories of protests, starting from the home page. The user ends up on the summary page for the protest they click on.


Representative Task 2:
	In this task, the user is retrieving the event page for an event they already created, so that they can share its URL with a friend. This is done by logging into their account and looking at the list of protests they made, and clicking on the relevant one.


Representative Task 3:
	In this task, the user is creating a protest which is a pro-gun demonstration. This is done by going to the protest creation page, filling out the relevant information, and submitting it. The user is then presented with a summary page about the protest, along with a shareable link.
